# Raspi & Arduino


The point of this project is to send data from an ESP8266 to a raspi 3 over wifi using a LAMP-server on the raspi.

I will first attempt this over my home wifi (or whatever network is available) and then by setting up a wifi host on the raspi and connecting the esp8266 directly.

End goal is to have 6+ esp8266 connected and sending data simultaneously.
